                <h1>Procedural Plant Propagation Project</h1>
                <h6>The goal of this project is to practice the manipulation of 
                    meshes, and actors, in response to the lighting. Having them
                    "Grow" if lit, and stagnate, eventually withering if they 
                    are unlit. </h6>
            </div>
            <!-- <div class="col-sm-6" style='align-content: left; align-self: center;'>
                
            <h2>MM/DD/YYYY Name</h2>
            <h6></h6>
            </div> -->
            
            <div class="row" style=' align-self: center;'>
                <h2>02/25/2021 The world is not flat. (duh?)</h2>
                <h6>
                        As it currently stands the world is dark, flat, and ugly, . 
                        I don't believe that this is reflective of a world I want, so I am
                        going to change that. We will start by making it round, and perhaps 
                        make the light look better. 
                </h6>
                 
                <div class="col-sm-5" style='align-content: left;'>
                    <image src="images/world1.png" alt='world1 image'>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6" style='align-content: right;'>
                   <h6> As you can see this is easier said than done. I need to 
                    rebuild the way gravity works, as well as the way seeds 
                    distribute themselves. 
                    </br>
                    Right now seeds spawn at a set level, 0, and they kinda 
                    ignore the ground.
                   </h6>
                </div>

             <div class="row" style=' align-self: center;'>
                <div class="col-sm-6" style='align-content: left; align-self: center;'>

                <h2>02/24/2021 The Flowers</h2>
                <h6>
                    Naturally you can't have a a plant that doesn't make babies, to
                    make plant babys a lot of plants use flowers - lets try that.
                </h6>
                <br/>
                <h6>To make the flower, I used a sphere and a cone as a place holder.
                    The flower is circled in red, and its babys are circled in blue.
                    Plants have maximum heights that are randomly assigned within 
                    a range at the start. When they make babys, the babies inherit the 
                    maximum height from their parents, with some deviation.</h6>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6" style='align-content: left; align-self: center;'>
                    <image src="images/flower1.png" alt='flower1 image'>
                </div>
             </div>
            
           
 
            <!--The light source -->
             <div class="row" style=' align-self: center;'>
                <div class="col-sm-5" style="align-self: center;" >
                    <h2>02/22/2021 The Light source</h2>
                    <h6>To start, I needed to see if light was hitting something; 
                        while my eyes can tell me whats lit, UNreal Engine was less 
                        cooperative. I settled on a solution revolving around rays.</h6>
                     <br/>
                    <h6>On every tick, I cast 300 rays, centered on my light sources.
                        If they strike an object, and that object is a plant, then they
                        increase the amount of energy that plant has.</h6>
                    <br/>
                    <h6>The rays are always being cast, even if they are not visible.
                    While this may seem like a lot of separate interactions, rays casting
                    is actually one of the "cheapest" calculations you can do in Unreal
                    Engine, unless you have to visualize them all! The video on this
                    page is almost 10 times the size of the video on the previous 
                    page, and thats with additional compression done to it, all 
                    due to the fact the video has to update all the rays.
                    </h6>
